## 🔬 Micrograd Project
**Duration:** Nov 2023 – Jan 2024  
Emulates PyTorch's autograd functionality for scalar values. Includes a custom neural network module with backpropagation.  
-	Created the framework that emulates the functionality of PyTorch’s ‘grad’ function, designed to operate  with scalar values rather than tensors.
-	Implemented a streamlined neural network module within the project, showcasing the application of the custom grad function for seamless backpropagation, thus optimizing the NN iteratively by refinement and minimization of the loss function throughout the training process.

## 🚀 SpaceX Launch Prediction (Applied Data Science Capstone)
**Duration:** Sept 2023 – Oct 2023  
Predicts Falcon 9 first-stage landing success using classification models. Includes web-scraping, SQL, and interactive visualizations.  
-	Project involved SpaceX dataset to develop a Machine Learning model predicting successful landing of Falcon 9 rocket's first stage, crucial for achieving a cost reduction to $62 million per launch
-	Accomplished Data collection through API and WebScraping, Data Wrangling with pandas, Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL and Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn) and Interactive Visual Analysis (Folium, plotly, dash)
-	Tested four types of Classification models viz. Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and k-Nearest Neighbour using scikit-learn. The Decision Tree model works best for the dataset with accuracy of 87.3214

## 📊 Business Analytics with Excel
**Duration:** Jun 2023 – Jul 2023  
Optimizes project selection and manager assignment using Solver, goal-seek, and data tables in Excel.  
-	The Excel project involves assisting manager for Project Development in managing project proposals while balancing capital expenditures, revenue streams and risks
-	Found an optimal set of projects for various functional areas by employing tools like Solver, goal-seek and data-table satisfying following constraints :
    o	company’s discount rate of 12% to calculate npv
    o	yearly capex less than $4 billion
    o	total project capex less than $10 billion
-	Assign senior managers to all the approved projects by employing Solver to find solution for a complex scenario involving 20 constraints considering the availability and skillset of various managers to lead the projects.

## 📉 EDA in Python (Loan Default Risk)
**Duration:** Dec 2024  
Explores loan applicant data to identify risk factors and recommend approval strategies. 
-	The goal of EDA was to explore data and find relationship among variables and provide recommendations to the financial body so as to minimize the probability to approve a potential Defaulter’s loan. The EDA project is a part of the course ‘Data Toolkit’ from Executive Post Graduate Certificate in Data Science & AI.
-	The dataset contains the information about the loan applicants and previous applications recorded by a financial body.
-	Demonstrated various steps involved in Data Analysis and drew recommendations based on the data. Some key recommendations: Prefer individuals with high income, higher education and individuals with apartment/house, commercial associates, pensioners and state servants.

## 🎬 RSVP Movies Case Study (EDA with SQL)
**Duration:** Feb 2025  
Analyzes movie data using MySQL to identify success factors for film production.  
-	mySQL was used as the DBMS to create a Database, create Tables followed by exploring the Data.
-	The goal of the case study is to find out the best combination of variables to be used by a big producer (RSVP movies) in order to have the highest probability of the movie to succeed. The repo in the link above contains dataset, the sql code and an executive summary containing recommendations after the EDA.
-	An online movies registry/database was used as a data source and the dataset consists of information regarding various movies worldwide including movie production houses, directors, movie actors, year, etc.

## 🧠 Predicting Employee Retention
**Duration:** Apr 2025  
Builds a logistic regression model to predict employee attrition using RFE and statistical validation.  
-	The data of the employees is provided and we have to predict whether an employee will stay or leave the company. 
-	EDA is done in order to understand the data, manage missing data, ensure correct dtypes and then to explore relationships and patterns among variables using univariate and multivariate analysis.
-	A classification model is then built for the project after selecting 15 variables from the dataset that might be best for training the model using RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination). P-values and VIF of all variables were examined after the iterations of models. 
-	The performance evaluation of the classification model is done and the model shows accuracy of 73.87% on the testing data (unseen data).
